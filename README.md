# Dog & Cat Classification with PyTorch

## Introduction 

Personal  to building deep learning model to classification images of Dogs and Cats using PyTorch libaray.

## Training Set

The data  used for the project was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats), including labelled images of Dogs and Cats (12500 images each), and unlabelled ones. 

## Training Method

Labelled data was used to train the model, 12500 images for each categories was divided 80% as train data and 20% as test data as shown:



$\qquad$ data/ <br>
$\qquad$ $\qquad$ train/ <br>
$\qquad$ $\qquad$ $\qquad$  | -- cat (10000 images) <br>
$\qquad$ $\qquad$ $\qquad$  | -- dogs (10000 images) <br>
$\qquad$ $\qquad$ test/ <br>
$\qquad$ $\qquad$ $\qquad$  | -- cat (2500 images) <br>
$\qquad$ $\qquad$ $\qquad$  | -- dogs (2500 images) <br>
